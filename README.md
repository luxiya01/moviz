[Moviz](https://luxiya01.github.io/moviz/) is a visualization of movies produced and consumed over the world between 2000 and 2019. The database consists of ~5700 movies produced between 2000 and 2019, with world-wide box office data scrapped from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) and movie detail information scrapped from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/).

This project is created by 6 students at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) for the course *Information Visualization*. For details on tools used and member contributions, see the [about page](https://luxiya01.github.io/moviz/about).
